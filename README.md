# DSA-Practice

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions in C++.  
The goal of this repo is to track my daily progress and build a solid foundation for coding interviews.

## üîç Contents

The problems are categorized by topic for better organization:

- [Arrays](./Arrays)
- [Linked Lists](./LinkedList)
- [Stacks & Queues](./Stacks_Queues)
- [Trees](./Trees)
- [Graphs](./Graphs)
- [Recursion & Backtracking](./Recursion_Backtracking)
- [Dynamic Programming](./DP)
- [Greedy Algorithms](./Greedy)
- [Sorting & Searching](./Sorting_Searching)
- [Miscellaneous](./Misc)

Each folder contains C++ solutions, and more will be added regularly.

## ‚úÖ Goal

- Solve **1-2 problems daily**
- Improve problem-solving speed and clarity
- Focus on clean and optimal code

## üìå Note

- All solutions are written in **C++**
- Solutions may include brief comments to explain the logic
- Some problems are from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, and InterviewBit
